ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection using CNN

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze MRI images for detecting brain tumors. By learning patterns from medical imaging data, the model can classify scans as tumor or non-tumor, supporting early diagnosis and reducing human error. It aims to assist healthcare professionals with faster and more reliable results.
